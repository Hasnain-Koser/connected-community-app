## Inspiration

Nowadays with growing housing societies it is extremely hard to keep up and maintain the society, as the housing society grows larger and larger 
communication gap is created and can cause multiple conflicts and problems with the society, especially during this time of pandemic where face-to-face 
communication and collaboration is not possible and announcements on society billboards or posters are not effective as a result of nobody ever leaving their
homes. Even though some housing societies might have some sort of communication on social media platforms such as WhatsApp, it is yet hard to keep up 
with the different initiatives, events and occurrences happening in the society.

I was able to notice a similar problem with the housing society that I reside in during the COVID-19 pandemic where most of the communication was done online. which I aim to solve through the creation of solution and platform that will be able to connect the entire community and promote participation, awareness and communication within the society
